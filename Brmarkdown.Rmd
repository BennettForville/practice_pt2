The sample students data set has `r nrow(students)` rows. 

### Average student age by grade
```{r}
students %>% # take the dataâ€¦
  
  group_by(grade) %>% # split by grade
  
  summarise(mean_age = mean(age)) 
```

### Number of students in each grade
```{r}
students %>% 
  group_by(grade) %>% 
  summarise(n())
```

### Number of students in the entire data set
```{r}
nrow(students)
```

### Number of boys and girls in 9th grade
```{r}
students %>% 
  filter(grade == 9) %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(n())
```

### Number of males and females over 17
```{r}
students %>% 
  filter(age>=17) %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(n())
```

### Number of A's, B's, C's for all students 
```{r}
grades %>% 
  group_by(letter_grade) %>% 
  summarise(n())
```

### Course with the most failing grades
```{r}
grades %>% 
  filter(score<50) %>% 
  group_by(course) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  slice_max(n)
```
